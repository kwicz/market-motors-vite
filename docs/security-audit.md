## Security Vulnerabilities & Recommendations ðŸš¨

### Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing CSRF Protection

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks

**Current State:** No CSRF protection implemented  
**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

#### 2. Insufficient Session Security

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Session hijacking, fixation attacks

**Current State:** Basic session configuration  
**Recommendation:** Implement session rotation, secure session storage

#### 3. Missing Security Monitoring

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Delayed detection of security incidents

**Current State:** Basic error logging  
**Recommendation:** Implement security event monitoring and alerting

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP) Improvements

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** XSS attacks, code injection

**Current State:** Basic CSP configuration  
**Recommendation:** Implement stricter CSP with nonce/hash-based policies

#### 5. API Security Headers

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Various web-based attacks

**Current State:** Basic security headers  
**Recommendation:** Add additional security headers (HSTS, etc.)

#### 6. Input Sanitization Enhancement

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** XSS, HTML injection

**Current State:** Schema validation only  
**Recommendation:** Add HTML sanitization for user-generated content

### Low Priority Issues

#### 7. Audit Logging

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Impact:** Compliance, forensics

**Current State:** Basic request logging  
**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive audit trail

#### 8. API Versioning Security

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Impact:** Backward compatibility vulnerabilities

**Current State:** No versioning strategy  
**Recommendation:** Implement API versioning with deprecation policies
